# Rebel-Game-Dev-JRPG
This is our club-wide project that aims to provide an easy introduction to game development with Unity! We have included various pre-made
scripts, tools, and scriptable objects for your use :) <br />

## Our Goal
We aim to promote creativity and diversity in video game experiences by allowing all members to contribute their own scenes, tools, and
assets of their own. Feel free to reach out to any of the officers with any questions!
