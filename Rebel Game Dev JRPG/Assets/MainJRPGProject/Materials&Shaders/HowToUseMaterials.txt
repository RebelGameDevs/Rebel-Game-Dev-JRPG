Rebel Game Dev Cheat Sheet On How To Use Materials:

NOTE: (of course you can import your own materials, but for generic on color uses please do not create any)

To use materials in Unity... you can simple right click to create a material in the project tab in any directory folder. The issue with this is file size.
Normally this is okay for projects that are small, but since this is a open source project where anyone can participate we don't wan't thousands if not
tens of thousands of materials. To combat this you can use material instancing upon using base materials if need be. There will be a base (WHITE) mat.
This material can be used for base things. 

==================================================================================================================================
Example: you want a blue material on a object:

	--> You will first attach the RebelGameDevsMaterialInstancer (script component) to the object that you want use this material. 
	--> Then you will drag the white material (in the base material folder) into the material field in the script in the inspector
	--> Then you select a color you would like to use for that material (a color field in inspector can use glow as well :)). When 
			the scene plays you will see that the material will be instanced. 
==================================================================================================================================

The above method also works for prefabs (something spawned in outside of start time). We are using void Awake() which is called when
	the object is created and not when the scene starts.
